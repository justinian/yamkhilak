# Yamkhilak

This is a word generator for constructed languages (conlangs) that I wrote
mostly as a way to learn a little about creating conlangs, and also to try out
[Janet](https://janet-lang.org) in a project that's bigger than just a single
file.

The name _yamkhilak_ (Pronounced _/jamÏ‡ilak/_ - [IPA Reader][IPA]) comes from
my language Kankhri, meaning "word creator".
